## Purpose: Remind myself what I learn in SCSS

1. Two CSS preprocessors to choose from:
    - [Less](https://lesscss.org/) - JavaScript
    - [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Ruby On Rail

1. Sass has two syntaxes avail:
    - Sass (Syntactically Awesome SytleSheets) in .sass files - indentations
    - SCSS (Sassy CSS) in .scss files - syntax more closely to CSS

1. Remember:
    - Sass is the name of the preprocessor
    - SCSS is more similar to CSS and easier to learn
    - all resources online mention Sass, not SCSS
    - all features are available for both systaxes
    - everything in SCSS is available in Sass
    - a CSS file is a valid SCSS file - compatibility  
    - difference between Sass and SCSS is [subtle](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax).
