##  Indexes: 
-  speed up data search and SQL query performance
-  reduce the number of data pages that have to be read in order to find the specific record
-  less reads are required to retrieve the records requested by a query or stored procedure 
-  Therefore, fewer disk I/O are preformed and the operation is completed faster

-  Biggest challenge with indexing: 
-  to determine the right ones for each table
